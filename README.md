# Bridge33 Dbt Data Warehouse

## Setup 

1) Install Python requirements
2) Setup your `profiles.yml`
   1) You can get the connection information following these [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/en/integrations/compute-details.html).


### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test

## Quick Caveat

I am going to move the dbt project into its own repo. The `.env` file needs to exist at the root of the project in order for the Dbt Power User extension to work.
